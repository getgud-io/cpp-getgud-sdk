# GetGud C++ SDK

## What Can You Do With Getgud's SDK:

Getgud's C++ SDK allows you to integrate your game with the GetGud platform. Once integrated, you will be able to:

- Stream live Game data to Getgud's cloud (In-match Actions, In-match Reports, In-match Chat messages)
- Send Reports about historical matches to Getgud.
- Send (and update) player information to Getgud.

## Prerequisites

To start, we should understand the basic structure Getgud's SDK uses to understand an FPS: 

**Titles->1->N->Games->1->N->Matches->1->N->Actions**

* The top container in Getgud's SDK is `Title`, which represents a literal gameâ€™s title, you as a client can have many titles, for example, a `Title` named CS:GO represents the CS:GO video game.

  ```
  Example of Title: CS:GO 
  ```

* Next up is `Game`, it is a container of matches that belong to the same `Title` from the same server session, where mostly the same players in the same teams, play one or more `Matches` together. You as a client can identify every game with a unique `gameGuid` that is provided to you once the `Game` starts. 

  ```
  An example of a Game is a CS:GO Game which has 30 macthes (AKA rounds) inside it.
  ```

* `Match` represents the actual play time that is streamed for analysis.  Like `Game`, `Match` also has a GUID which will be provided to you once you start a new match.

  ```
  An example of a Match is a single CS:GO round inside the game.
  ```

* `Action` represents an in-match activity that is associated with a player. We collect six different action types which are common to all first person shooter gamnes:

1. `Spwan` - Whenever a player appears or reappears in-match, on the map.
2. `Death` - A death of a player.
3. `Position` - player position change (including looking direction). 128 tick sensitive.
4. `Attack` - Whenever a player initiates any action that might cause damage, now or in the future. Examples: shooting, throwning a granade, planting a bomb, swinging a sword, punching, firing a photon torpedo, etc...
5. `Damage` - Whenever a player recieves any damage, from players or the environment.
6. `Heal` - Whenever a player is healed.


## Getting Started

Insert the Title Id and Private Key you recieved from Getgud.io to the following environment variables:

```
//Windows
setx CONFIG_PATH \path\to\config_file
setx LOG_FILE_PATH \path\to\log_file

//Linux
CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config_file
LOG_FILE_PATH=/path/to/log_file
```

For multiple title support on the same machine you can use the following overloaded methods:

```cpp
std::string StartGame(int titleId,
                      std::string privateKey,
                      std::string serverGuid,
                      std::string gameMode);
...
bool SendReports(int titleId,
                 std::string privateKey,
                 std::deque<ReportInfo>& reports);
...
bool UpdatePlayers(int titleId,
                   std::string privateKey,
                   std::deque<PlayerInfo>& players);
```

Include the follwing header file:

```cpp
#include "../include/GetGudSdk.h"
```

Initialize the SDK:

```cpp
GetGudSdk::Init();
```

Start a Game:

```cpp
std::string gameGuid = GetGudSdk::StartGame(
  "us-west-1", // serverGuid
  "deathmatch" // gameMode
);
```

Once the Game starts, you'll recieve the Game's guid.
Now you can start a Match:

```cpp
std::string matchGuid = GetGudSdk::StartMatch(
  gameGuid, 
  "Knives-only", // matchMode
  "de-dust" // mapName
);
```

Once you have a match, you can send Actions to it.
Let's create a vector of Actions and send it to the match:

```cpp
//Create a vector of Actions
std::deque<GetGudSdk::BaseActionData*> actionsToSend {
new GetGudSdk::SpawnActionData(
            matchGuid, curTimeEpoch, "player-10", "ttr", 0, 100.f,
            GetGudSdk::PositionF{1, 2, 3}, GetGudSdk::RotationF{10, 20}),
			
new GetGudSdk::PositionActionData(
          matchGuid, curTimeEpoch, "player-5",
          GetGudSdk::PositionF{20.32000f, 50.001421f, 0.30021f},
          GetGudSdk::RotationF{10, 20})
};

//Send it to the SDK
GetGudSdk::SendActions(actionsVector);

//Clean up the actions
for (auto* sentAction : actionsVector)
    delete sentAction;
  actionsVector.clear();
```

End a game (All Game's Matches will close as well):

```cpp
bool gameEnded = GetGudSdk::MarkEndGame(gameGuid);
```

Close and Dispose of the SDK:

```cpp
GetGudSdk::Dispose();
```

## SDK Methods

### StartGame(serverName, gameMode)

To start a new game, call `StartGame()`, this will use the environment variables `TITLE_ID` and `PRIVATE_KEY`.
`StartGame` returns `gameGuid` - a unique identifier of the game which you will use later to start new Matches inside the Game as well as to end the Game when it is over.

```cpp
std::string gameGuid = GetGudSdk::StartGame(serverName, gameMode);
```
* `serverName` - a qunique name of your game server - String, Alphanumeric, 36 chars max.
* `gameMode` - the mode of the game (each mode has a separate AI learning processes) - String, Alphanumeric, 36 chars max.

#### StartGame(titleId, privateKey, serverName, gameMode)

You can also call the `StartGame()` method with titleId and privateKey that you pass (supporting multiple titles on the same machine)

```cpp
std::string gameGuid = GetGudSdk::StartGame(titleId, privateKey, serverName, gameMode);
```
* `titleId` - The title Id you recieved from Getgud.io
* `privateKey` - The Private Key for the above title you recieved together with it's Title Id
* `serverName` - a qunique name of your game server - String, Alphanumeric, 36 chars max.
* `gameMode` - the mode of the game (each mode has an additional AI learning processes) - String, Alphanumeric, 36 chars max.

### StartMatch(gameGuid, matchMode, mapName)

Once you've started a live Game, you can now attach Matches to that Game.
When a live Match starts it returns a `matchGuid`, you'll need it to add Actions, Chat, and Reports to that match
To start a new match for a live game, call `StartMatch()`:

```cpp
std::string matchGuid = GetGudSdk::StartMatch(gameGuid, matchMode, mapName);
```
* `gameGuid` - The Game guid you recieved when starting a new Game
* `matchMode` - the mode of the match (each mode has an additional AI learning processes) - String, Alphanumeric, 36 chars max.
* `mapName` - the unique name of the map - String, Alphanumeric, 36 chars max.

### AddActions(std::deque<BaseActionData*> actions)

Once you've started a Match, you can now send actions to it.
To add a batch of actions to a match, use the `SendActions` function.
This is an async method which will not block the calling thread.

```cpp
bool SendActions(std::deque<BaseActionData*> actions);
```
* `actions` - deque of `BaseActionData` objects, where `BaseActionData` is the base calss of all the primal 6 actions (Spawn, Position, Attack, Damage, Heal and Death).

#### AddAction(BaseActionData* action)

You can also send single actions when you need to, using the `AddAction()` method.
This is an async method which will not block the calling thread.

```cpp
bool SendActions(action);
```
* `action` - a `BaseActionData` object that is the base class of all the primal 6 actions (Spawn, Position, Attack, Damage, Heal and Death).

### MarkEndGame(gameGuid)

Ends a live Game and it's associated matches.
When the live Game ends, you should mark it as finished in order to close it on Getgud's side.
Once the game is marked as ended, it will not accept new live data.

```cpp
bool gameEnded = GetGudSdk::MarkEndGame(gameGuid);
```
* `gameGuid` - The Game guid you recieved when starting a new Game

`MarkEndGame` returns true/false depending if the Game was successfully closed or not.

## Creating Actions 

When a live Match starts, you can add Actions, Chat Data, and Reports to it. 
There are 6 Action types you can add to the Match, all derived from base action which holds the actions base properties.

### Base Action

`BaseAction` is the base class that all actions derive from and holds common information to all action.

```cpp
BaseAction(std::string matchGuid,
        long long actionTimeEpoch,
        std::string playerId)
```
* `matchGuid` - guid of the live Match where the action happened, is given to you when `StartMatch` is called.
* `actionTimeEpoch` - epoch time in milliseconds when the action happened
* `playerId` - your player Id (which will called playerGuid on Getgud's side) 

### Spawn Action

To create a Spawn Action, use the `SpawnActionData` class. This action marks the appearance or reappearance of a `Player` inside the Match.

```cpp
GetGudSdk::BaseActionData* action = new SpawnActionData(
        BaseAction::baseAction,
        std::string characterGuid,
        int teamId,
        float initialHealth,
        PositionF position,
        RotationF rotation);
```
* `baseAction` - See BaseAction
* `characterGuid` - guid of the spwaned character from your game, max length is 10 chars.
* `teamId` - TODO
* `initialHealth` - TODO
* `position` - X,Y,Z coordinates of the player at the moment of action.
* `rotation` - PITCH, ROLL rotation of player view at the moment of action.

### Position Action

To create a Position Action, use the `PositionActionData` class.
This action marks the change of `Player` position and view site. You can send this every tick, up to 128 ticks.

```cpp
GetGudSdk::BaseActionData* action = new GetGudSdk::PositionActionData(
                     BaseAction::baseAction,
                     PositionF position,
                     RotationF rotation
);
```
* `BaseAction` - See BaseAction
* `Position` - X,Y,Z coordinates of the player at the moment of action.
* `Rotation` - PITCH, ROLL rotation of player view at the moment of action.

### Attack Action

To create an Attack Action, use the `AttackActionData` Class.
An Attack action is any attempt to create damage, now or in the future, for example, firing a shot, swinging a sword, placing a bomb, throwing a grenade, or any other action that may result in damage.
Note that the Attack action is not bound to the `Damage` action, it is an attempt to cause Damage, not the Damage event itself.

```cpp
GetGudSdk::BaseActionData* action = new GetGudSdk::AttackActionData(
                     BaseAction:: baseAction,
                     std::string attackerPlayerId,
                     std::string weaponGuid,
);
```
* `BaseAction` - See BaseAction
* `attackerPlayerId` - A unique name (your player id) of the player which created the damage, if the damage was created by the environment, you can singal this by using the 'PvE' symbol as the player guid.
* `weaponGuid` - A unique name of the weapon that the attack was performed with, max length is 36 chars.

### Damage Action

To create a Damage Action, use the `DamageActionData` class. A Damage should be triggered when a player loses health, both PVP and PVE. If the Damage is caused by the environment you can specify this in a playerGuid using a predefined variable `GetGudSdk::Values::Environment`

```cpp
GetGudSdk::BaseActionData* action = new GetGudSdk::DamageActionData(
                     BaseAction:: baseAction,
                     std::string victimPlayerGuid,
                     float damageDone,
                     std::string weaponGuid
);
```
* `BaseAction` - See BaseAction
* `victimPlayerGuid` - guid AKA nickname of the player who is the victim of the Damage action, max length is 36 chars.
* `damageDone` - How much damage was given
* `weaponGuid` - A unique name of the weapon that the attack was performed with, max length is 36 chars.

### Heal Action

To create a heal action, use the `HealActionData` class. A Heal action causes the player to increase his health while healing.

```cpp
GetGudSdk::BaseActionData* action = new GetGudSdk::HealActionData(
                     BaseAction:: baseAction,
                     float healthGained
);
```
* `BaseAction` - See BaseAction
* `healthGained` - How much health the player gained.

### Death Action

To create a death action to a match, use the `DeathActionData` class. The Death player causes the player to Die, if the player died it should ALWAYS be marked. We do not detect this automatically.

```cpp
GetGudSdk::BaseActionData* action = new GetGudSdk::DeathActionData(BaseAction:: baseAction)
);
```
* `BaseAction` - See BaseAction

## Adding Chat Messages
To add a chat massge to a live Match:

```cpp
GetGudSdk::ChatMessageInfo messageData;
messageData.message = "Hi from Getgud!";
messageData.messageTimeEpoch = 1684059337532;
messageData.playerId = "player1";
GetGudSdk::SendChatMessage(
  "6a3d1732-8f72-12eb-bdef-56d89392f384", // matchGuid 
  messageData
);
```

## Adding Reports

To add a reports to a live Match:
Note that all of the fields are optional exept `MatchGuid` and `SuspectedPlayerId` (a report must have a valid match and player).

```cpp
GetGudSdk::ReportInfo reportInfo;
reportInfo.MatchGuid = "6a3d1732-8f72-12eb-bdef-56d89392f384";
reportInfo.ReportedTimeEpoch = 1684059337532;
reportInfo.ReporterName = "player1";
reportInfo.ReporterSubType = 0;
reportInfo.ReporterType = 0;
reportInfo.SuggestedToxicityScore = 100;
reportInfo.SuspectedPlayerId = "player1";
reportInfo.TbSubType = 0;
reportInfo.TbTimeEpoch = 1684059337532;
reportInfo.TbType = 0;
GetGudSdk::SendInMatchReport(reportInfo);
```
* `MatchGuid`- guid of the live Match you are sending a report to **(Mandatory field)**
* `ReportedTimeEpoch`- epoch time of when the report was created **(optional field)**
* `ReporterName`- the name of the entity that created the report **(optional field)**
* `ReporterType`- the type of the entity that created the report **(optional field)** (ART TODO: ADD BELOW THE ENUMS, SAME FOR ALL EMUNS, THEY MUST BE HERE)
* `ReporterSubType`-   the subtype of the entity that created the report **(optional field)**
* `SuggestedToxicityScore`- 0-100 toxicity score, ie: how much do you suspect the player **(optional field)**
* `SuspectedPlayerId`- the player Id of the suspected player **(Mandatory field)**
* `TbType` - id of the toxic behavior type, for example, Aimbot **(optional field)**
* `TbSubType` - id of the toxic behavior subtype, for example, Spinbot **(optional field)**
* `TbTimeEpoch` - epoch time of when the toxic behavior event occured **(optional field)**

Note: for Reporter and Tb types and subtypes you should use reference tables provided to you by Getgud to determine the correct mapping to Ids (TODO: ART: provide thge enums here)

### Sending Reports to Historical Matches

To add a reports to a histotical Match (a match which is not live and has ended):

```cpp
std::deque<GetGudSdk::ReportInfo> reports;
GetGudSdk::ReportInfo reportInfo;
reportInfo.MatchGuid = "549cf69d-0d55-4849-b2d1-a49a4f0a0b1e";
reportInfo.ReportedTimeEpoch = 1684059337532;
reportInfo.ReporterName = "player1";
reportInfo.ReporterSubType = 0;
reportInfo.ReporterType = 0;
reportInfo.SuggestedToxicityScore = 100;
reportInfo.SuspectedPlayerId = "player1";
reportInfo.TbSubType = 0;
reportInfo.TbTimeEpoch = 1684059337532;
reportInfo.TbType = 0;
reports.push_back(reportInfo);

GetGudSdk::SendReports(
  28, // titleId
  "6a3d1732-8f72-12eb-bdef-56d89392f384",  // privateKey
  reports
);
```
You can also use SendReports function without `titleId` and `privateKey` arguments, in case you have `TITLE_ID` and `PRIVATE_KEY` env variables defined.

Deque of reports:

```cpp
GetGudSdk::SendReports(
  reports
);
```

## Sending Player Updates

To update player information, you can call `UpdatePlayers`:

```cpp
std::deque<GetGudSdk::PlayerInfo> playerInfos;
GetGudSdk::PlayerInfo playerInfo;
playerInfo.PlayerId = "549cf69d-0d55-4849-b2d1-a49a4f0a0b1e";
playerInfo.PlayerNickname = "test";
playerInfo.PlayerEmail = "test@test.com";
playerInfo.PlayerRank = 10;
playerInfo."playerSuspectScore": 12,
playerInfo."playerReputation": "esteemed",
playerInfo.PlayerJoinDateEpoch = 1684059337532;
playerInfos.push_back(playerInfo);
bool playersUpdated = GetGudSdk::UpdatePlayers(
  28, //titleId
  "6a3d1732-8f72-12eb-bdef-56d89392f384", // privateKet
  players
);
```
* `PlayerId`- Your player Id - String, 36 chars max.
* `PlayerNickname`- Nickname of the player **(optional field)**
* `PlayerEmail`- Email of the player **(optional field)**
* `PlayerRank`- Integer rank of the player **(optional field)**
* `playerSuspectScore`- Integer between 1-100 that indicatews how suspicious this player is to you **(optional field)**
* `playerReputation`- A String represention the reputation of the player, 36 chars max. **(optional field)**
* `PlayerJoinDateEpoch`:  Date when the player joined **(optional field)**

Note, that all fields are optional except player Id.
As you see similarly to SendReports we use a deque of PlayerInfo objects to send it to Getgud SDK.
This is an async method which will not block the calling thread.

You can use the `UpdatePlayers` function without `titleId` and `privateKey` arguments, in case you have `TITLE_ID` and `PRIVATE_KEY` env variables defined.

```cpp
bool playersUpdated = GetGudSdk::UpdatePlayers(players);
```

Here is the description of each player field:
